# Node package for calculating area of a triangle

## About
This basic node package provides a function within index.js that calculates the area of a triangle given the user specifies values for the base and height. After installing the node package you can open up terminal or whatever bash your using and jump into Nodejs REPL by typing the command 'node'.

After getting into the Nodejs REPL shell you can declare a variable to hold the behavior of the triangle area calcuator function within the index.js file. You can do this by specifying a variable in the shell by typing,
var calcArea = require('./index.js')
out: Undefined

Now you can pass arguments to the area function,
calcArea(10,20)
out: 'Area of the triangle = 100'
