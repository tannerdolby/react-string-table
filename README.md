I originally created this string variation table using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. Now this repository holds the React version. I enjoyed learning the fundamentals of React on [freeCodeCamp](https://freeCodeCamp.org), so I thought why not practice my skills by converting a previous project entirely to React!
