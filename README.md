I created this string variation table [previously](https://github.com/tannercd/stringtable-web) using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. Now this repository holds the React version. 

I enjoyed learning the fundamentals of React on [freeCodeCamp](https://freeCodeCamp.org), so I thought why not practice my React skills by converting a previous project entirely to React!
